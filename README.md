# Assignment_4_ANA_515
This repository contains assignment #4 for ANA-515. Completed by Rob Brown, 5/9/2021. 

This repository contains the 6 zipped files downloaded from the Google page linked off of the Data Flair site for this project. I tried to upload the unzipped csv files; however, they were too big. 
I also uploaded the R code (.R) file that I used to seed the code blocks for my R Markdown file (.rmd), the R Markdown file, and the Word doc that was generated after the knitting process.
